# About
I am using this repo on GitHub to help me expand my skills with Frontend Development and Design using JavaScript, CSS and hopefully when I am advanced enough React. I want to expand my coding know-how to be bigger and better than before and there there is no better way then project based learning, so the next 30 days, I will be making JavaScript projects
